# Asymmetry Extraction Methods

The two methods shows extracting transverse single-spin asymmetry (`A_N`) assuming equal relative luminosity (`r = 1`).

For detailed descriptions of these methods, please refer to the full document on the [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/dpchhpgxfzmn#aae7ab).

The final asymmetry in both methods is scaled by the factor `f`, defined as: f = dilution_factor × packing_fraction × ((P↑ + P↓) / 2)
